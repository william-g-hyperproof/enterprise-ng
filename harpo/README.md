# harpo

This is a demo platform for various technologies, including a pub-sub system.
It uses Gradle for builds. If you don't have Gradle installed, the wrapper `./gradlew` is included.

Useful targets:

- `gradle bootRun` - run the application immediately
- `gradle bootJar` - create a runnable JAR file
